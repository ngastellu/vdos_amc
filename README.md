This repo contains useful scripts to run:

    * launch MD simulations of amorphous graphene (LAMMPS)
    * extract/plot the vibrational density of states from a MD trajectory

The most up-to-date (as of 12/02/2026) version of the VDOS codes are currently in `rorqual_code`.
It was written to analyse extract the MD trajectory of a single graphene sample.
